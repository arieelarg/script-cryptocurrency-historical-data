## Description

This project is an initial approach to MachineLearning. The idea was to get historical data of some cryptocurrencies and work with a prediction model to see if I should sell or buy tokens.

## Steps to be executed

1. Get data from coingecko API
2. Train the model with a third of the data (test train split)
3. Test the other % to see metrics: loss-average, accuracy, F1 score.
4. Enhance!
